# HTML Tables Lesson Plan: My Favorite Things

## Lesson Objective
By the end of this lesson, students will understand the basic structure of HTML tables and create their own "My Favorite Things" table.

## Materials Needed
- Computers with a simple text editor visual studio code for each student
- Projector or large screen to demonstrate
- Whiteboard and markers

## Lesson Plan

### 1. Introduction (5 minutes)
- Greet the class and recap the previous lesson on HTML basics.
- Introduce the concept of tables: "Today, we're going to learn how to make tables in HTML. Tables help us organize information neatly, like in a grid!"
- Show a simple table drawn on the whiteboard as an example.

### 2. Explain HTML Table Structure (10 minutes)
- Introduce the main elements:
  - `<table>`: Starts and ends the table
  - `<tr>`: Table row
  - `<th>`: Table header
  - `<td>`: Table data (cell)
- Draw these on the whiteboard and explain their relationships.
- Show a simple HTML code example on the projector.

### 3. Demo: Creating a Simple Table (10 minutes)
- Using the projector, create a simple 2x2 table about favorite fruits.
- Type out the HTML code, explaining each step:
  ```html
  <table border="1">
    <tr>
      <th>Fruit</th>
      <th>Color</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Apple</td>
      <td>Red</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  ```
- Save and display the result, pointing out how the code relates to the displayed table.

### 4. Guided Practice: Start "My Favorite Things" Table (15 minutes)
- Introduce the "My Favorite Things" project.
- Guide students to open their text editors and start with the basic HTML structure.
- Help them create the table structure step-by-step, pausing to let them type each part:
  - Table and first row with headers
  - First content row (e.g., favorite animal)
- Encourage students to choose their own favorites to fill in the table.

### 5. Independent Practice (20 minutes)
- Let students continue building their tables independently.
- Encourage them to add more rows for different categories (color, food, hobby, etc.).
- Circulate to help and answer questions.
- Challenge faster students to add images to their tables.


### 6. Wrap-up and Preview (5 minutes)
- Recap what we learned about HTML tables.
- Preview the next lesson: "Next time, we'll learn how to make our tables look even cooler with something called CSS!"
- Encourage students to think about other information they could organize in tables.

## Extension Activities
- For fast finishers, introduce the concept of table spanning (colspan and rowspan).
- Suggest creating a table about their weekly schedule or favorite school subjects.

## Assessment
- Check completed "My Favorite Things" tables for correct HTML structure.
- Observe student participation and understanding during the guided and independent practice.
